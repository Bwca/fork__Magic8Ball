# Magic8Ball

This is a fork from the amazing [repo](https://github.com/cywarr/Magic8Ball) by [cwarr](https://github.com/cywarr)

I intend to use it as a renderer for my own magic ball 8, since I suck at THREE.js and 3d modelling, so I rewrite it to typescript, classes and other abhorrent stuff in order for it to work as a pluggable npm package.
